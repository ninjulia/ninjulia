Additionally, I facilitated a ground-up redesign for a cable and internet service provider which resulted in over 1000 online orders within the first 9 months of launch and email campaigns with above-industry-average click-through rates.

While I am committed to quality and attention to detail, I don't like to take myself too seriously. In my spare time I love exploring new cities 📷, and keeping up with web design trends and technologies 📚. I'm currently looking for companies that believe in remote work and the pursuit of work-life balance. I am always looking to expand my horizons by taking on new projects, learning new toolsets, and meeting new people.
